# Banking System Implementation


This repository contains the implementation of a basic Banking System with varying levels of complexity. It is structured in two main Python files:

- `banking_system.py`: Defines the base class for a banking system interface.
- `banking_system_impl.py`: Implements the methods of the banking system, with different levels of difficulty


### Overview
This final project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming concepts. The base class methods defined in `banking_system.py` are implemented and extended in `banking_system_impl.py`. The implementation includes a variety of banking operations, such as account creation, transactions, and balance management, each progressively increasing in complexity.

### Usage
The `test` directory contains tests cases for the banking system implementation that increase in complexity as the levels increase from one to four. To run these tests simply run the follwoing command in the terminal:
```bash
bash run_single_test.sh "<test_case_name>"
```
The test case names are found within the corresponding python files in the tests directory.
